# Lab4 - 2/13/26
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- View, search within, copy, move, and rename files. Create new directories.
- Use wildcards (`*`) to perform operations on multiple files.
- Make a file read only.
- Use the `history` command to view and repeat recently used commands.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- How can I view and search file contents?
- How can I create, copy and delete files and directories?
- How can I control who has permission to modify a file?
- How can I repeat recently used commands?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### EXERCISE 1: NAVIGATION PRACTICE
Navigate to your untrimmed_fastq directory in one command
    cd gen711-811/shell_data/untrimmed_fastq/


### EXERCISE 2: WILDCARDS
What would the output look like if the wildcard could *not* be matched? Compare the outputs
    Error: ls: cannot access '*fastq': No such file or directory
        Solution: make a directory or find which one you wanted to go to originally


### EXERCISE 3: NAVIGATING PRACTICE
Navigate to your home directory. From there, list the contents of the untrimmed_fastq directory.
    ls gen711-811/shell_data/untrimmed_fastq/


:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Relative path resolution

Using the filesystem diagram below, if `pwd` displays `/Users/thing`,
what will `ls ../backup` display?

1. `../backup: No such file or directory`
2. `2012-12-01 2013-01-08 2013-01-27`
3. `2012-12-01/ 2013-01-08/ 2013-01-27/`
4. `original pnas_final pnas_sub` (CORRECT ANSWER)

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

1. No: there *is* a directory `backup` in `/Users`. 
2. No: this is the content of `Users/thing/backup`,
  but with `..` we asked for one level further up.
3. No: see previous explanation.
  Also, we did not specify `-F` to display `/` at the end of the directory names.
4. Yes: `../backup` refers to `/Users/backup`. (THIS IS WHY)

### EXERCISE 4: FINDING HIDDEN DIRECTORIES
First navigate to the shell_data directory. There is a hidden directory within this directory. Explore the options for ls to find out how to see hidden directories. List the contents of the directory and identify the name of the text file in that directory.

Hint: hidden files and folders in Unix start with ., for example .my_hidden_directory

What is the hidden file name in the hidden directory?
    .DS_Store

### EXERCISE 5: HISTORY
Find the line number in your history for the command that listed all the .sh files in /usr/bin. Rerun that command.
    ls /usr/bin/*.sh (view scrips)
        ls /usr/bin/*c | wc -l (word count in folder)
            !(command number) --> repeats specific command from history 
            !294

### EXERCISE 6: FILE CONTENTS
Print out the contents of the ~/shell_data/untrimmed_fastq/SRR097977.fastq file. What is the last line of the file?
    tail SRR097977.fastq (all ending lines)
    tail -n(number) SRR097977.fastq (specific number of last lines)

### EXERCISE 7: PATHS
From your home directory, and without changing directories, use one short command to print the contents of all of the files in the ~/shell_data/untrimmed_fastq directory.


### EXERCISE 8: LESS (Sequence is TTTTT)
What are the next three nucleotides (characters) after the first instance of the sequence quoted above?
   (using less)
    1. CAC. (press 'n' on the keyboard to find the next match)
   (using grep)
    Can run grep 'TTTTT' *fastq to find all places of specific 

### File Permissions Help
The first part of the output for the `-l` flag gives you information about the file's current permissions. There are ten slots in the
permissions list. The first character in this list is related to file type, not permissions, so we'll ignore it for now. The next three
characters relate to the permissions that the file owner has, the next three relate to the permissions for group members, and the final
three characters specify what other users outside of your group can do with the file. We're going to concentrate on the three positions
that deal with your permissions (as the file owner).

![](fig/rwx_figure.svg){alt='Permissions breakdown'}

Here the three positions that relate to the file owner are `rw-`. The `r` means that you have permission to read the file, the `w`
indicates that you have permission to write to (i.e. make changes to) the file, and the third position is a `-`, indicating that you
don't have permission to carry out the ability encoded by that space (this is the space where `x` or executable ability is stored, we'll
talk more about this later.

### EXERCISE 9
Starting in the shell_data/untrimmed_fastq/ directory, do the following:

Make sure that you have deleted your backup directory and all files it contains.
Create a backup of each of your FASTQ files using cp. (Note: You’ll need to do this individually for each of the two FASTQ files. We haven’t learned yet how to do this with a wildcard.)
Use a wildcard to move all of your backup files to a new backup directory.
Change the permissions on all of your backup files to be write-protected.


### EXERCISE 10: PROGRAMS
After loading a conda environment, where is the program 'fastqc' stored?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- You can view file contents using `less`, `cat`, `head` or `tail`.
- The commands `cp`, `mv`, and `mkdir` are useful for manipulating existing files and creating new directories.
- You can view file permissions using `ls -l` and change permissions using `chmod`.
- The `history` command and the up arrow on your keyboard can be used to repeat recently used commands.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


cp = copy
cp (file) (new file)
move backup file --> mv
